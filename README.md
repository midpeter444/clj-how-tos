# clj-how-tos

This is a top level project bucket for code-base How-tos for various things in Clojure.

## Current How-Tos

### clj-sockets

Clojure relies on the Java socket library for its basic socket handling.  There is one undocumented library in Clojars called server-socket.  I've put together a simple "echo server" code example to show how to use it.

### go-lightly

A foray into implementing the concurrency constructs of the Go language in Clojure, using what Clojure provides out of the box, what Java provides through interop, existing Clojure libraries and whatever else I need to construct to make it work.

This is in the very early stages of exploration and I'm documenting that exploration a series of blog posts.  The first one is available:
